# Welcome

Most discussions are happening on the [Telegram Group](https://t.me/golangmalaysia). The intention of this site is to collect knowledge sharing via blog posts.

### Current Agenda

We're trying to host a meetup at least once a month on the last Tuesday.

### Community driven

Anybody can contribute to this site. Just check out and submit us your pull request.

The repository is at https://github.com/golang-my/golang-my.github.io-hugo.

[How to contribute](/post/contrib-howto/).

### Telegram Group

Join our telegram group [Golang Malaysia](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAD_0LOtBImDV8gn0jA) for discussions and latest updates on the meetups.

For those new to Go, get your questions answered here at [Belajar Golang](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEF5prptfwTvnEhZng). You can share snippets of your codes through [Golang Playground](https://play.golang.org) and get feedback from other helpful members.
