# Welcome

Most discussions are happening on the [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mygolang/). The intention of this site is to collect knowledge sharing via blog posts.

### Current Agenda

We're trying to host a meetup at least once a month on the last Tuesday.

### Community driven

Anybody can contribute to this site. Just check out and submit us your pull request.

The repository is at [https://github.com/golang-my/golang-my.github.io-hugo].

* *Tutorial coming soon*
